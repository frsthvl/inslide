# HOW?

Just append an encoded URL to the base URL like this:
`https://insli.de/<encoded_url_to_markdown_file.md>`

Or simply use [/new](https://insli.de/new) to let the magic happen.

Yeah okay I admit you still have to write the `markdown` content **yourself**

But hey, it's markdown! _It's easy!_

Use [this example](https://insli.de/welcome.md) to get started

Just host the file in your Github

Or... I don't know... Dropbox? Google Drive? Your own server?

# I don't care!

I don't store _your_ content

I don't <span style="color: #f97316">track</span> _you_

I don't even know who _you_ are

## But I know you're <span style="color: #db2777">awesome!</span> üéâ

So go ahead and [create](https://insli.de/about) your first presentation

# GO

# NOW
